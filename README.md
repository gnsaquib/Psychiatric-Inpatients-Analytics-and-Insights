# Key Analyses (SQL):
 * Analyzed length of stay and total cost for patients with schizophrenia spectrum and mood disorders, grouped by demographics.
 * Compared Emergency Department (ED) usage between psychiatric and non-psychiatric admissions.
 * Assessed severity of illness and mortality risk for psychiatric patients.
 * Identified high-risk, high-cost psychiatric cases for targeted insights.
# Dashboards (Tableau):
* CCS Diagnosis Dashboard:
  * Bar chart of patient counts by diagnosis
  * Pie chart showing diagnosis share by volume
  * Treemap of ED usage by diagnosis
  * Table showing average length of stay
    
* CCS Procedure Dashboard:
  * Top & Bottom N procedures by patient volume
  * Boxplot of average length of stay by procedure
  * Treemap of illness severity by procedure
